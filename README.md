## About

This is a mod for [Heroes of Newerth](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com) to constantly display the inventory of each player as part of the in-game UI. Usually the inventory only shows if you mouse-over a player, which can be tough in the heat-of-battle. This mod allows you to always have visual access to everyone's inventory.

## Installing
0. You will need the [HoN Mod Manager](https://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/index.php?/topic/112-hon-mod-manager-download/) to use this mod. So first, install that.

1. Once that is installed, you can download the latest release of the `Constant Inventory Mod` mod from [here](http://github.com/mrhappyasthma/HoN-Constant-Inventory-Mod/releases/download/Latest/ConstantInventoryMod.honmod).

2. Place the downloaded `HoN-Constant-Inventory-Mod.honmod` file into your Heroes of Newerth directory under `game/mod` folders. For example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of Newerth\game\mods`.

3. Open up `HoN Mod Manager` and enable `Constant Inventory Mod` mod: <br/><br/>

*Note: You will need to re-apply mods every time HoN is updated.* <br/><br/>
*This is done manually by opening HoN Mod Manager. It will detect the version change and give you a pop-up asking if you'd like to re-apply. Click yes, and you're good to go! If not, you're client WILL be very buggy.*

## Updating
Updating is also done through the `HoN Mod Manager`. Simply click on `File -> Download Mod Updates`: <br/><br/>
